# Profile Page Fix - Complete Implementation

## What Was Fixed

### Issue
The ProfilePage was not properly integrated with the Supabase database. It was using static state that wasn't being saved or loaded from the database.

### Solution Implemented

#### 1. **Database Integration**
- ProfilePage now uses `useUserData()` hook to fetch real profile data
- Integrates with `UserDataService` to save/update profiles
- Automatically fetches data from Supabase Auth if profile doesn't exist

#### 2. **Auto-Creation from Supabase Auth**
- When user first accesses profile page, if no profile exists in `user_profiles` table
- System automatically fetches user data from `auth.users` table
- Creates profile with: email, name, phone from auth metadata
- Works with any auth provider (Clerk, Supabase Auth, etc.)

#### 3. **Fixed Recursive Call Bug**
- **Problem**: `createOrUpdateProfile()` was calling `getUserProfile()`, which could trigger auto-creation again
- **Solution**: Changed to direct database query to avoid recursion
- Now safely checks for existing profile without triggering infinite loop

#### 4. **Complete Form Fields**
The profile page now includes:
- **Personal Information**:
  - First Name (required) *
  - Last Name (required) *
  - Email (read-only)
  - Phone Number (required) *
  - Date of Birth (required) *
  - Gender
  - Occupation
  - Education Level

- **Address Information**:
  - Street Address
  - City
  - State
  - ZIP Code
  - Country

- **Location Services**:
  - Enable/view GPS location
  - Shows current city, state
  - Used for weather and regional rates

#### 5. **User Experience Features**

**Profile Completion Indicator**
- Shows orange alert if required fields are missing
- Lists exactly which fields need to be filled
- Encourages completion for better recommendations

**Save Status Feedback**
- Shows "Saving..." spinner during save
- Green success message after successful save
- Red error message if save fails
- Auto-clears after 3-5 seconds

**Loading States**
- Full-page loader while fetching profile
- Button loaders during save/location operations
- Disabled state prevents double-submissions

**Profile Picture**
- Shows first initial in colored circle
- Camera icon for future upload functionality
- Displays user's full name when available

**Location Services Section**
- Blue info box about location features
- "Enable Location" button if not enabled
- Shows current location if enabled
- Used for weather widget and insurance rates

## How It Works

### First Time User Flow
```
User logs in
    ↓
Navigates to Profile page
    ↓
useUserData hook loads
    ↓
Profile not found in user_profiles
    ↓
getUserProfile() fetches from Supabase Auth
    ↓
Creates profile with auth data (email, name, phone)
    ↓
Profile appears with partial data
    ↓
User fills remaining fields
    ↓
Click "Save Profile"
    ↓
Updates database
    ↓
Shows success message
```

### Returning User Flow
```
User logs in
    ↓
Navigates to Profile page
    ↓
useUserData hook loads
    ↓
Profile found in user_profiles
    ↓
Loads all saved data into form
    ↓
User can edit any field
    ↓
Click "Save Profile"
    ↓
Updates database
    ↓
Shows success message
```

## Database Schema

Profile data is stored in `user_profiles` table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE user_profiles (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id uuid NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  email text NOT NULL,
  first_name text,
  last_name text,
  full_name text,
  phone text,
  date_of_birth date,
  gender text,
  occupation text,
  education_level text,
  address jsonb,
  location text,
  created_at timestamptz DEFAULT now(),
  updated_at timestamptz DEFAULT now()
);
```

Address is stored as JSON:
```json
{
  "street": "123 Main St",
  "city": "San Francisco",
  "state": "CA",
  "zipCode": "94102",
  "country": "USA"
}
```
