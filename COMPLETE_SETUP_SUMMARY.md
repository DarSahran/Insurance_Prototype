# Complete Setup Summary - Insurance Platform with Storage & Auth

## What Was Implemented

### ✅ Storage Integration
- **Supabase Storage**: Files uploaded to `medical_records` bucket
- **File Organization**: Automatic user-based folder structure (`{user_id}/{timestamp}_{filename}`)
- **Security**: Row Level Security policies ensure users only access their own files
- **File Operations**: Upload, download, delete with proper cleanup

### ✅ User Profile Auto-Creation
- **Automatic**: Profiles created on first app access
- **Data Source**: Fetches from Supabase Auth (`auth.users` table)
- **Metadata**: Pulls email, name, phone from authentication provider
- **Fallback**: Uses email username if no name provided

### ✅ OCR Service Updates
- **Storage Upload**: Files saved to Supabase Storage before processing
- **Path Tracking**: Database stores file path for later retrieval
- **Cleanup**: Deleting document also removes file from storage
- **Download**: Added method to download original files

## SQL Scripts You Need to Run

### 1. Database Tables (Main Migration)
**File**: Already in `supabase/migrations/` folder

Run this in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Creates 7 tables: user_locations, weather_data, regional_insurance_rates,
-- ocr_documents, insurance_recommendations_cache, weather_history, geolocation_cache

-- (Copy from the migration file provided earlier)
```

### 2. Storage Bucket Policies
**File**: `SUPABASE_STORAGE_SETUP.sql`

Run this in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Enable RLS
ALTER TABLE storage.objects ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Create 4 policies for upload, view, update, delete
CREATE POLICY "Users can upload own documents" ON storage.objects...
CREATE POLICY "Users can view own documents" ON storage.objects...
CREATE POLICY "Users can update own documents" ON storage.objects...
CREATE POLICY "Users can delete own documents" ON storage.objects...
```

## Supabase Dashboard Setup

### Step 1: Create Storage Bucket
1. Go to **Storage** in left sidebar
2. Click **Create a new bucket**
3. Name: `medical_records`
4. **IMPORTANT**: Keep it **PRIVATE** (not public)
5. Set file size limit: 10 MB
6. Click **Create bucket**

### Step 2: Run SQL Scripts
1. Go to **SQL Editor**
2. Create new query
3. Paste the database tables SQL
4. Click **Run**
5. Create another new query
6. Paste the storage policies SQL
7. Click **Run**

### Step 3: Verify Setup
1. Check **Storage** > `medical_records` bucket exists
2. Check **Database** > Tables shows all 7 new tables
3. Run verification query to confirm RLS policies

## How It Works

### File Upload Flow
```
User uploads file
    ↓
Frontend validates (size, type)
    ↓
File uploads to: medical_records/{user_id}/{timestamp}_{filename}
    ↓
Database record created in ocr_documents table
    ↓
OCR processing extracts text
    ↓
Structured data parsed (medical, financial, ID data)
    ↓
Status updated to 'completed'
```

### User Profile Flow
```
User logs in
    ↓
App checks user_profiles table
    ↓
Profile not found?
    ↓
Fetch from Supabase Auth (auth.users)
    ↓
Create profile with auth data
    ↓
Return profile to app
```

### File Security
```
User A uploads file
    ↓
Saved to: medical_records/user-a-id/file.pdf
    ↓
User A can access: ✅
User B tries to access: ❌ Permission denied
Admin can access: ❌ (unless special policy added)
```

## Testing Your Setup

### Test 1: Upload Document
1. Login to app
2. Go to Document Center
3. Click "Upload Document"
4. Select file and type
5. Upload should succeed
6. Check Supabase Storage to verify file exists

### Test 2: View Documents
1. Uploaded documents should appear in list
2. Should show filename, size, confidence score
3. Only your documents should be visible

### Test 3: Delete Document
1. Click delete icon on a document
2. Confirm deletion
3. Check Supabase Storage - file should be gone
4. Check database - record should be deleted

### Test 4: User Profile
1. Login with new user
2. Profile should auto-create
3. Check user_profiles table in Supabase
4. Should see new row with user's auth data

## Environment Variables

Make sure your `.env` has:

```env
# Required
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key

# Optional (has fallbacks)
VITE_OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your-key
VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your-key
VITE_GOOGLE_CLOUD_VISION_API_KEY=your-key
VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=your-key
```

## Security Features

### ✅ Implemented
- **Storage RLS**: Users can only access their own files
- **Database RLS**: All tables have proper access controls
- **User Isolation**: File paths include user ID
- **Authenticated Requests**: All operations require valid auth token
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Deleting document removes both DB record and file

### 🔒 Best Practices Applied
- Private bucket (not public)
- Sanitized filenames
- File size limits
- Confidence scoring for OCR
- Manual verification flags
- Error handling throughout

## Quick Commands

### Run Migration (if using CLI)
```bash
supabase migration up
```

### Test Build
```bash
npm run build
```

### Check for Issues
```bash
npm run lint
```

---

## Common Issues & Solutions

### "Storage object not found"
- **Cause**: RLS policies missing
- **Fix**: Run storage policies SQL script

### "Permission denied" on upload
- **Cause**: Bucket is public or policies wrong
- **Fix**: Ensure bucket is PRIVATE, re-run policies

### "User profile not created"
- **Cause**: Auth metadata missing
- **Fix**: Profiles auto-create with available auth data

### "CORS error"
- **Cause**: Domain not whitelisted
- **Fix**: Add your domain in Supabase Storage config

---

## Next Steps

After setup is complete:

1. ✅ Test document upload
2. ✅ Test document download
3. ✅ Test document deletion
4. ✅ Verify user isolation
5. ✅ Test profile auto-creation
6. ✅ Add API keys for full functionality
7. ✅ Configure CORS for production domain
8. ✅ Set up monitoring/alerts
9. ✅ Implement file quotas (optional)
10. ✅ Add virus scanning (optional, for production)

## Final Notes

The platform is now a fully functional, secure, data-driven application with:
