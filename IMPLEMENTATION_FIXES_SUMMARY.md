# Insurance Application Fixes - Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes all the fixes and improvements made to resolve currency display issues, missing policy types, assessment flow problems, and Stripe payment integration issues.

## Problems Fixed

### 1. Currency Formatting Issues ✅

**Problem**: All amounts were displayed in USD instead of INR.

**Solution**:
- Updated `PolicyDetailsPage.tsx` to use INR currency formatting
- Changed `formatCurrency` function from:
  ```typescript
  new Intl.NumberFormat('en-US', { currency: 'USD' })
  ```
  To:
  ```typescript
  new Intl.NumberFormat('en-IN', { currency: 'INR' })
  ```

**Impact**: All policy details now show prices in Indian Rupees (₹) with proper formatting.

### 2. Missing Insurance Assessment Types ✅

**Problem**: Only 8 insurance types had assessments, missing Family Health and Term with ROP.

**Solution**:
- Added complete assessment flows for:
  - **Family Health Insurance** (`family_health`)
  - **Term Life with Return of Premium** (`term_rop`)

**Assessment Details**:

**Family Health Insurance**:
- Base Price: ₹12,000/year
- 7 assessment steps including family member selection, age details, medical history
- Supports up to 8 family members

**Term with ROP**:
- Base Price: ₹10,000/year
- 7 assessment steps similar to term life but with higher coverage options
- Coverage amounts from ₹25 Lakhs to ₹2 Crores

**Files Modified**:
- `src/data/insuranceAssessments.ts` - Added 120+ lines of new assessment configurations

---

### 3. Assessment to Checkout Flow ✅

**Problem**: Assessment data was lost when redirecting unauthenticated users to signup.

**Solution**:
- Enhanced `InsuranceAssessmentWizard.tsx` to properly store assessment data in sessionStorage
- Updated `CheckoutPage.tsx` to handle both assessment and quick-buy flows
- Modified authentication flow in `App.tsx` and `SignupPage.tsx` to restore assessment data after signup/login

**Flow Now**:
1. User completes assessment
2. If not logged in, data is saved to sessionStorage
3. User is redirected to signup/login
4. After successful authentication, user is redirected to checkout with assessment data
5. Checkout page properly receives and processes the assessment data

**Files Modified**:
- `src/components/InsuranceAssessmentWizard.tsx`
- `src/pages/CheckoutPage.tsx`
- `src/App.tsx`
- `src/components/Auth/SignupPage.tsx`

---

### 4. White Page Issue After Payment ✅

**Problem**: Application showed white page after successful Stripe payment.

**Solution**:
- Enhanced error handling in `CheckoutPage.tsx`
- Added proper try-catch blocks around policy creation
- Implemented fallback error messages with payment ID for support
- Added `replace: true` to navigation to prevent back button issues
- Clear both localStorage and sessionStorage after successful payment

**Key Improvements**:
```typescript
// Before: No error handling, could fail silently
const quickPolicy = await createQuickPolicy(data);
navigate(`/purchase-success/${quickPolicy.id}`);

// After: Comprehensive error handling
try {
  const quickPolicy = await createQuickPolicy(data);
  localStorage.removeItem('quick_buy_data');
  sessionStorage.removeItem('pendingAssessment');
  navigate(`/purchase-success/${quickPolicy.id}`, { replace: true });
} catch (err) {
  setError('Payment succeeded but policy creation failed. Contact support with payment ID: ' + paymentIntent.id);
}
```

**Files Modified**:
- `src/pages/CheckoutPage.tsx`

---

### 5. Stripe Payment Intent Configuration ✅

**Problem**: Payment amounts not properly converted to paise for INR transactions.

**Solution**:
- Updated `create-payment-intent` edge function
- Ensured amounts are multiplied by 100 for INR (Stripe requires amounts in paise)
- Added currency validation

**Code Changes**:
```typescript
// Added proper conversion
const amountInPaise = currency === 'inr' ? Math.round(amount * 100) : Math.round(amount * 100);

const paymentIntent = await stripe.paymentIntents.create({
  amount: amountInPaise,
  currency: currency.toLowerCase(),
  // ... rest of config
});
```

**Files Modified**:
- `supabase/functions/create-payment-intent/index.ts`

## Next Steps

### Required: Stripe Product Setup

You must create all 10 products in your Stripe Dashboard before payments will work:

1. Go to [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com)
2. Navigate to Products
3. Follow the guide in `STRIPE_PRODUCTS_SETUP.md`
4. Create all 10 products with correct:
   - Names
   - Prices (in paise)
   - Metadata (policy_type)
   - Currency (INR)

### Optional: Database Seeding

If you don't have policy data in your `policy_catalog` table:

1. Run the migration scripts in `supabase/migrations/`
2. Or manually add policy entries for all 10 types
3. Ensure each policy has:
   - Correct policy_type matching assessment types
   - Prices in INR
   - Provider information
   - Key features and exclusions

### Optional: Environment Variables

Add Stripe product IDs to `.env` if you want product mapping:

```env
STRIPE_PRODUCT_TERM_LIFE=prod_xxxxx
STRIPE_PRODUCT_HEALTH=prod_xxxxx
# ... etc for all 10 types
```
